1. Git saves changes to code through staging which is telling git exactly
which changes you want to add to the next snapshot.
2. Git makes tracking code possible by using branches. Branches allow
isolation from other changes in code development.
3. Git allows sharing code by using the push command. The push command takes
commits from your local repo and writes them to a remote repo.
